                <h1>Define Virus :</h1>
                <p>Humans have been battling viruses since before our species had even evolved into its modern form. For
                    some viral diseases, vaccines and antiviral drugs have allowed us to keep infections from spreading
                    widely, and have helped sick people recover. For one disease — smallpox — we've been able to
                    eradicate it, ridding the world of new cases.

                    But we're a long way from winning the fight against viruses. In recent decades, several viruses have
                    jumped from animals to humans and triggered sizable outbreaks, claiming thousands of lives. The
                    viral strain that drove the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa kills up to 90% of the people it
                    infects, making it the most lethal member of the Ebola family.

                    But there are other viruses out there that are equally deadly, and some that are even deadlier. Some
                    viruses, including the novel coronavirus currently driving outbreaks around the globe, have lower
                    fatality rates, but still pose a serious threat to public health as we don't yet have the means to
                    combat them.</p>

                <H1>Marburg virus :</H1>
                <p>Scientists identified Marburg virus in 1967, when small outbreaks occurred among lab workers in
                    Germany
                    who were exposed to infected monkeys imported from Uganda. Marburg virus is similar to Ebola in that
                    both can cause hemorrhagic fever, meaning that infected people develop high fevers and bleeding
                    throughout the body that can lead to shock, organ failure and death.

                    The mortality rate in the first outbreak was 25%, but it was more than 80% in the 1998-2000 outbreak
                    in
                    the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as in the 2005 outbreak in Angola, according to the World
                    Health Organization (WHO).

                <p>These <strong>Precautions</strong> include wearing of protective gown,gloves and mask; placing the

                <h1>Ebula Virus :</h1>
                <p>The first known Ebola outbreaks in humans struck simultaneously in the Republic of the Sudan and the
                    Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. Ebola is spread through contact with blood or other body
                    fluids, or tissue from infected people or animals. The known strains vary dramatically in their
                    deadliness, Elke Muhlberger, an Ebola virus expert and associate professor of microbiology at Boston
                    University, told Live Science.

                    One strain, Ebola Reston, doesn't even make people sick. But for the Bundibugyo strain, the fatality
                    rate is up to 50%, and it is up to 71% for the Sudan strain, according to WHO.

                    The outbreak underway in West Africa began in early 2014, and is the largest and most complex
                    outbreak of the disease to date, according to WHO.

                <p>Although rabies vaccines for pets, which were introduced in the 1920s, have helped make the disease
                    exceedingly rare in the developed world, this condition remains a serious problem in India and parts
                    of Africa.

                    "It destroys the brain, it's a really, really bad disease," Muhlberger said. "We have a vaccine
                    against rabies, and we have antibodies that work against rabies, so if someone gets bitten by a
                    rabid animal we can treat this person," she said.

                    However, she said, "if you don't get treatment, there's a 100% possibility you will die."</p>

                    <h1>HIV Virus :</h1>
                    <p>In the modern world, the deadliest virus of all may be HIV. "It is still the one that is the
                        biggest killer," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and spokesman for the
                        Infectious Disease Society of America.

                        An estimated 32 million people have died from HIV since the disease was first recognized in the
                        early 1980s. "The infectious disease that takes the biggest toll on mankind right now is HIV,"
                        Adalja said.

                        Powerful antiviral drugs have made it possible for people to live for years with HIV. But the
                        disease continues to devastate many low- and middle-income countries, where 95% of new HIV
                        infections occur. Nearly 1 in every 25 adults within the WHO African region is HIV-positive,
                        accounting for more than two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide.

                    <h1>Smallpox Virus:</h1>
                    <p>In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared the world free of smallpox. But before that, humans
                        battled smallpox for thousands of years, and the disease killed about 1 in 3 of those it
                        infected. It left survivors with deep, permanent scars and, often, blindness.

                        Mortality rates were far higher in populations outside of Europe, where people had little
                        contact with the virus before visitors brought it to their regions. For example, historians
                        estimate 90% of the native population of the Americas died from smallpox introduced by European
                        explorers. In the 20th century alone, smallpox killed 300 million people.

                        "It was something that had a huge burden on the planet, not just death but also blindness, and
                        that's what spurred the campaign to eradicate from the Earth," Adalja said.</p>

                    <h1>Hantavirus Virus :</h1>
                    <p>Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) first gained wide attention in the U.S. in 1993, when a
                        healthy, young Navajo man and his fiancée living in the Four Corners area of the United States
                        died within days of developing shortness of breath. A few months later, health authorities
                        isolated hantavirus from a deer mouse living in the home of one of the infected people. More
                        than 600 people in the U.S. have now contracted HPS, and 36% have died from the disease,
                        according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

                        The virus is not transmitted from one person to another, rather, people contract the disease
                        from exposure to the droppings of infected mice.

                        Previously, a different hantavirus caused an outbreak in the early 1950s, during the Korean War,
                        according to a 2010 paper in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews. More than 3,000 troops
                        became infected, and about 12% of them died.

                        While the virus was new to Western medicine when it was discovered in the U.S., researchers
                        realized later that Navajo medical traditions describe a similar illness, and linked the disease
                        to mice.</p>

                        to international collaboration on research and innovation. The year ends with COVID-19 vaccines
                        rolling out – an extraordinary feat.

                    <h1>Influnza Virus :</h1>
                    <p>Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus.[1]
                        Symptoms can range from mild to severe and commonly include: high fever, runny nose, sore
                        throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, and feeling tired.[5] These symptoms
                        typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week, although
                        the coughing may last for more than two weeks.[1][6] In children, there may be diarrhea and
                        vomiting, but these are not common in adults.[7] Diarrhea and vomiting occur more commonly in
                        gastroenteritis, which is an unrelated disease sometimes referred to as "stomach flu" or the
                        "24-hour flu".[7] Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial
                        pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart
                        failure.</p>
                        <h3> Precautions :</h3>
                <p>These <strong>Precautions</strong> include wearing of protective gown,gloves and mask; placing the
                    infected individual in strict isolation; and sterilization or proper disposal of needles, equipment,
                    and patient excretion. </p>

                    <p>A virus is an infectious agent that can only replicate within a host organism. Viruses can
                        infect
                        a variety of living organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals. Viruses are so small
                        that a microscope is necessary to visualize them, and they have a very simple structure.</p>
